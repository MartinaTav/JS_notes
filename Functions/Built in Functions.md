# Functions - Built in

Functions allow us to group together sets of statements.
Functions can take in **arguments**
When you **pass a data into a function they are called _arguments_ and then they perform some work and that is what is referred to as a statement and then sometimes they also return a value.**

```javascript
Math.max(10, 12);
// 12

// it will return the highest number

Math.floor(2.333);
// 2

parseFloat('15.8567');
// 15.8567 it will be returned as a number

parseInt('15.8567');
// 15 as a whole nuber

Date.now();
// without any arguments
// it will return us a number in milliseconds since January 1970
```
